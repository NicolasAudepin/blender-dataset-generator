# blender dataset generator
 Creating a python script using blender to generate a dataset aimed at material creation from picture

 The blend file contains a script to generate random wall material and lighting environements. It then saves the Albedo, Roughness, Metalness and Normal of the material plus the lighting environement.  

 it currently has a prototype for random material generation and random environement generation. The post processing for the render imitating camera defaults(blur and noise) is not ready yet.
